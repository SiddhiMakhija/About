      <h1>HTML/CSS 🌐</h1>
      <p>
        My journey into web development began with two of the most powerful building blocks of the internet — <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. These languages taught me that creating something visually beautiful and functionally powerful doesn’t always need complex code — sometimes, a few well-written tags and some styling magic are all it takes. ✨  
        <br> <br>
        CSS brought creativity into the picture. Whether it's crafting elegant layouts using <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>CSS Grid</strong>, building fluid responsive designs, or adding smooth transitions and animations — I enjoy every second of styling a webpage into something that feels alive and interactive. 🎨🖱️  
        <br><br>
        For me, HTML & CSS aren’t just code — they’re my creative toolkit, where logic meets art. It’s where I can express ideas visually, share stories, and build digital experiences that people enjoy interacting with. 💡💻  
        <br><br>
        And this is just the beginning. With every new project, I'm excited to learn, experiment, and push the boundaries of what I can create on the web!
